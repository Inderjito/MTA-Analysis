Abstract
The New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) subway system experiences numerous operational disturbances. These incidents are pain points that impact subway operations, commutersâ€™ daily safety, and service reliability. This analysis aims to find the root cause and factors that influence subway rider experiences and daily travel schedules.

Objective
The goal of this project is to explore and uncover major challenges that disrupt services for New York City Subway riders. Millions of New Yorkers rely on the subway for daily commutes to work and other travel needs. Exploring the data will help to better understand some of the factors that influence delays and also look at patterns during different seasons of the year and weekends vs. weekdays, how that might contribute to some of the problems, and what MTA can do to improve service for NYC daily commuters.

Problem Statement
